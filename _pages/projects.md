## Antenna Selection Algorithm for Switch-based MIMO System

<img align="right" width="200" height="125" src="/images/6_MIMO.png">

Direction-of-arrival (DOA) is important in asset tracking, navigation, and communications.
The estimation performance is decided by a lot of factors, such as target direction, array layout, number of sources and so on.
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is now widely used, and several hybrid analog-digital structures are proposed to deal with space and power issues for a large array. Switch-based architecture is one of the promising solutions, which connects a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains to a larger number of antennas.
In this work, we want to improve DOA estimations by selecting appropriate antennas under different situations. Two DOA-based antenna selection algorithms, namely, a greedy algorithm and a neural network-based method, are proposed for the switch-based MIMO system using threshold region approximation. The proposed algorithms have low complexity and can sufficiently improve the results from the simulation, especially in the threshold region.

## Joint TDOA/PDOA Localization Using Particle Swarm Optimization

<img align="right" width="200" height="125" src="/images/5_tdoa_pdoa.png">

Estimating the location of a target is essential for many applications such as asset tracking, navigation, and data communications. Time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) based localization has the main advantage that it does not require synchronization between the transmitting and the receiving sides. Phase-difference-of-arrival (PDOA) provides additional information that can be leveraged to enhance localization performance. The combination of TDOA and PDOA for localization has not been reported in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates both TDOA and PDOA to achieve improved position estimation. In the proposed approach, an initial location estimate is obtained by optimizing a TDOA cost function. Next, a PDOA, or a hybrid TDOA-PDOA cost function is optimized using a particle swarm optimizer to obtain the final location estimate. Simulation results show that the proposed approach sufficiently, and justifiably, improves localization performance relative to pure TDOA methods.
