**Description**: A virtual kitchen environment is designed with a variety of built-in items such as kitchen tools, fruits, vegetable and so on. Kitchen Simulator intends to be: a). a virtual training environment for the users to learn how to use the tools inside a kitchen. b). a tool for the users to learn the name, nutrition information, cooking procedures of different dishes. c). a platform to analyze usersâ€™ behavior and preferences. The analyzing results could further be used in smart glass (AR) based kitchen/home assistant. [[Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QVYAik5vEY)\]\

## Smart Tap (NEOM AI Challenge Project)

<img align="right" width="300" height="188" src="/images/smart_tap_demo.png">

**Description**: We propose an AI-controlled tap to reduce the water wastage. In this system, a depth camera monitors the person and tracks the body joints information. The joint information is passed to a trained network to predict the future actions of the person and control the on/off of the tap. Wudu (very important procedure before the prayer in Islamic Countries) is performed as an example to evaluate the system. \[[Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-30Z7Omugw)\]\ \[[Project Page](https://github.com/isl-kaust/NEOM_AI_Challenge)\]
**My Contribution**: System integration and VR scene development.
