<img align="right" width="200" height="125" src="/images/4_VRKITCHEN.png">

In this project, we built a virtual kitchen environment with a variety of built-in items such as kitchen tools, fruits, vegetable and so on. Kitchen Simulator intends to be: a). a virtual training environment for the users to learn how to use the tools inside a kitchen. b). a tool for the users to learn the name, nutrition information, cooking procedures of different dishes. c). a platform to analyze usersâ€™ behavior and preferences. The analyzing results could further be used in smart glass (AR) based kitchen/home assistant. [Demo Video](youtube.com/watch?v=_QVYAik5vEY)
