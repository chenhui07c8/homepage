## RIS-Aided Localization and Sensing

<img align="right" width="240" height="150" src="/images/RIS_SL.png">

Reflective reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) constitute a promising emerging technology for extending coverage and dynamically programming signal propagation with almost zero-energy consumption. This technology can support or even enable wireless communications, as well as localization and sensing tasks in various scenarios. The research works on this topic include:
- Sidelink positioning (localize all the UEs without BSs involved) with multiple RIS <span style="color:red">[\*J16]</span> or cooperative strategy [\*J18]
- RIS calibration: joint RIS calibration and UE localization using passive RIS <span style="color:blue">[C14]</span>, <span style="color:orange">[\*J19]</span>, or HRIS <span style="color:blue">[\*J13]</span>
- RIS Localization: multi-static sensing of a RIS target [C15]
- RIS-aided monostatic sensing: sensing and object detection with double bounce multipath [C16], access-point-free SLAM [\*J14]

## MmWave/Terahertz Signal Localization

<img align="right" width="240" height="150" src="/images/fig_thz.png">

MmWave/Terahertz signals are expected in the fifth/sixth generation (5G/6G) communication systems. Benefiting from the large bandwidth and array size, improved radio localization performance can assist in communication and location-based services. The research works on this topic include:
- THz band localization tutorial [J6] with new signal features [J5]
- Localization under model mismatch: hardware impairment [C6], [\*J17], near-field and beam squint effect [C12], geometry mismatch [C17]
- Localization and sensing under mobility [C11], [C13]
- Evaluation of experimental data from a 5G base station [C8], [\*J15]
- Coverage analysis [C10], [\*J12]
- Requirements [C7] and visions for positioning and sensing in 6G [J10]
